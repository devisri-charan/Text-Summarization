# BERT Model for Summarizing Paragraphs

This is an example code for training a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for summarizing paragraphs. The model is trained using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Installation
To run this code, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install the following dependencies:
* pandas
* transformers
* scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```pip install pandas transformers scikit-learn```

## Usage
### Step 1: Collect dataset
Collect a dataset of paragraphs and their corresponding summaries. The dataset should be in a CSV file with two columns: 'text' and 'summary'. The 'text' column should contain the paragraphs and the 'summary' column should contain their corresponding summaries.

### Step 2: Preprocess dataset
Tokenize and encode the text and summary using a pre-trained tokenizer from the Hugging Face Transformers library. This will convert the text and summary into a format that can be used by the BERT model.

### Step 3: Split dataset into training and testing sets
Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets. This will be used to train the BERT model and evaluate its performance.

### Step 4: Train a Machine Learning model
Train a BERT model using the preprocessed training data. This will involve initializing the model, setting up an optimizer and learning rate scheduler, and training the model for a specified number of epochs.

### Step 5: Evaluate model performance
Evaluate the performance of the trained BERT model on the testing set. This will involve generating summaries for the testing set using the trained model and comparing them to the actual summaries using a performance metric such as mean squared error.

### Step 6: Deploy model for use in summarizing new paragraphs
Deploy the trained BERT model for use in summarizing new paragraphs. This will involve tokenizing and encoding the new paragraph using the pre-trained tokenizer and using the trained model to generate a summary for the new paragraph.

## Example code
See the ```bert_summarizer.py``` file for an example implementation of the BERT model for summarizing paragraphs. The file contains comments explaining each step of the process.

To run the example code, you need to have a dataset of paragraphs and their summaries in a CSV file named ```dataset.csv```. You also need to specify the name of the pre-trained BERT model to use for training the model. This can be done by changing the ```model_name``` variable in the code.

```python bert_summarizer.py```
